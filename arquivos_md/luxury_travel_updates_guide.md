- Explore the feasibility of allowing clients to access vendors' websites using my sign-in credentials. Assess the potential security and privacy implications, and recommend best practices for managing client access securely.
- Provide guidelines for clients to book their trips through these platforms seamlessly while ensuring a personalized and exclusive experience.
- Offer additional insights on how to maintain an ongoing relationship with clients, even after they have booked their trips, to enhance their travel experience.
