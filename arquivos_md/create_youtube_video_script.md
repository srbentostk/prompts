# PLANNING

Your goal is to write a Youtube video script based on the provided sources.

1. Analyze the provided sources thoroughly.
2. Study <example1> and <example2> carefully. You will be asked to replicate their:
    - Overall structure.
    - Tone and voice.
    - Formatting (including line breaks and spacing).
    - Length (aim for a similarly detailed post).
    - Absence of emojis.
    - Use of special characters (if any).
    - Emotional resonance.

<example1>
Most people fail at social media because they focus on the wrong metrics. It’s frustrating when you spend hours on content, only to get zero views. If you’re constantly creating and still not getting views, you’re probably screwing up something major.

When you get this right, you’ll see consistent growth in followers who actually care about you.

But if you don’t fix it, you’ll keep wasting time on content nobody sees, while slowly burning out.
</example1>

<example2>
Starting with zero followers feels impossible, but it’s not. Every big creator you see started at the same point.

The biggest mistake people make when starting is trying to do too much at once—posting on every platform, copying trends, and hoping for the best. But social media isn’t about doing everything; it’s about doing one thing well. Start by picking one platform and one niche you’re genuinely passionate about. If you love fitness, start with short workout tips on TikTok. Or if you’re into tech, review your favorite tech toys on YouTube. Focus on providing value to your audience—entertaining, educating, or inspiring them. Track what works and double down on it. Yes, it takes time, but consistency will set you apart. Remember, even 100 loyal followers are more valuable than 10,000 people who don’t care about you.

Start small: choose one platform, one niche, and show up every day. Track your progress, adjust your strategy, and watch your audience grow.

When you apply this approach, you’ll start to see results—and once you do, scaling becomes the next exciting challenge.

3.  Write 2 sentences emphasizing the key insight or actionable advice that clearly resolve the problem.
4. Write 1 sentence to transition smoothly to the next point.
