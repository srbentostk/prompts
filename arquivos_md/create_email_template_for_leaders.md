- Start with a compelling subject line that captures attention and relates to increasing profit through targeting profitable customers and products.
- Begin with a brief introduction that establishes credibility, mentioning your role as a management consultant focused on growth strategies for firms.
- Clearly outline the main purpose of the email, which is to discuss strategies for growing profits beyond existing plans by honing in on high-value customers and products.
- Highlight your consulting services that include continuous improvement and leadership development, emphasizing the long-term sustainable growth benefits.
- Use bullet points to summarize key points or action items, making the email easy to skim.
- End with a call-to-action, such as scheduling a meeting or requesting a follow-up to discuss how your strategies can be tailored to their specific needs.
- Be sure to keep the tone professional and respectful of their time, given their position at the top of the organization's hierarchy.
