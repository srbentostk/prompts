Create a documentary script outline in bullet points with brief explanations (1-2 sentences each), structured to assist in writing a 2000-word script based on these outlines. Ensure the outline fits within a two-page limit. Your outline should:

- Begin with a working title for the documentary.
- Include a brief introduction that sets the stage for the documentary's subject matter.
- Develop main section headings that represent key parts of the documentary. For each section:
  - Provide a bullet point for the title of the section.
  - Include a brief explanation or objective of the section in 1-2 sentences.
  - Suggest potential content, stories, or points to be covered in this section.
- Conclude with a section or bullet point summarizing the overall documentary message or takeaway.
- Ensure the outline is logically organized to transition smoothly between sections.
