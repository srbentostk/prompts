Create a comprehensive sales tracker plan tailored for an investment advisory team focusing on financial assets like Treasury bonds and various unit trusts. The goal of this sales tracker is to monitor sales performance and efficiency across different team members and asset classes. Ensure the tracker includes the following components:

- **Sales Tracking:**
  - Differentiate sales data between new accounts and top-ups on existing accounts.
  - Capture sales broken down by each financial asset category, such as Treasury bonds and unit trusts (e.g., XENO, BRITAM, UAP, SANLAM, ICEA, SBGS).

- **Team Performance:**
  - Track the individual sales performance of each team member on a weekly and monthly basis.
  - Display performance metrics using graph curves for visual clarity to show trends and progress over time.

- **Client Management:**
  - Classify clients into those whose deals have been closed and those with pending transactions.

- **Visualization and Report Generation:**
  - Suggest effective ways to visualize this data for easy understanding and quick decision-making by the team.
  - Provide insights on generating weekly and monthly reports that summarize team performance and sales data.

Provide a detailed step-by-step approach on how to implement this sales tracker, including the tools and methodologies that would be most effective for data collection and analysis. Ensure the plan is practical and scalable for a growing team and client base.
