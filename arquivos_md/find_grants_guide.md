Create a detailed guide to help me find grants for my business projects. The guide should cover:

- **Identification**: Steps to identify the types of grants available that align with the specific business projects I am pursuing.
- **Qualification Criteria**: A process to evaluate whether my business meets the qualification criteria for each grant.
- **Research Methods**: Techniques and resources to effectively search and find grants that are targeted towards my business type and industry.
- **Application Process**: Best practices for successfully applying for grants once identified.
- **Relevant Tools**: Suggestions for any databases, websites, or tools that can assist in tracking and managing grant opportunities.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
