Create a detailed lesson plan outline for an online bird and insect identification course designed to connect students with local wildlife, spark curiosity, and build observation skills. Your outline should cover the following areas:

- **Course Structure:**
  - Design interactive sessions where students learn to identify birds and insects. Include methods such as using identification guides, analyzing photographs, and listening to calls.
  - Develop engaging activities like matching games to help students pair bird calls with species.
  - Incorporate a unique challenge using lower-quality images to increase the difficulty level and help students sharpen their identification skills.

- **Field Trips and Journals:**
  - Plan a series of nature trips to local parks where students can use binoculars and field guides to observe birds and insects in their natural environment.
  - Include instructions for maintaining a nature journal. Each student should record their observations and reflect on their learning experiences throughout the course.

- **Course Outcome:**
  - Explain how this course fosters environmental awareness, encourages critical thinking, and develops respect for wildlife among students.

Your outline should be structured in a way that is engaging and educational, ensuring a well-rounded learning experience.
