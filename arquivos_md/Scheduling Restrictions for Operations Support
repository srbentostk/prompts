Create a business case for the need to implement scheduling restrictions for an operations support team handling alarm installs. Focus on the following key areas:

- **Highlight the Current Challenges:**
  - Explain the issue with the lack of control over scheduling and availability for same-day or late next-day installations.
  - Describe how these scheduling practices impact your team's ability to properly onboard new accounts before technicians arrive on site.

- **Justify the Need for a Scheduling Tool with Parameters:**
  - Argue the necessity of building parameters into the current customer-facing scheduling tool to prevent same-day installs.
  - Propose specific restrictions, such as disabling the option for same-day installs and preventing next-day scheduling after 12:00 PM.

- **Advocate for Human Involvement in Scheduling:**
  - Emphasize the importance of having real-life team members (as opposed to automated systems) involved in scheduling.
  - Discuss the benefits of human oversight in managing scheduling conflicts and ensuring adequate onboarding time.

- **Outline the Benefits of Implemented Changes:**
  - Detail how these changes would lead to improved efficiency and readiness for installations.
  - Highlight potential cost savings, customer satisfaction improvements, and operational benefits.

- **Pitch to Executive Leadership:**
  - Frame the argument in a way that resonates with executive priorities, such as productivity, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
  - Provide supporting data or hypothetical scenarios to strengthen your case.
