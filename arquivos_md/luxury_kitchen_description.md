Create a detailed description of a luxury kitchen renovation for a marketing agency's client specializing in Kitchen and Bathroom remodeling. The image should emphasize modern and sleek design elements. Include the following features:

- **Countertops:** Showcase high-end materials such as marble or quartz.
- **Appliances:** Include state-of-the-art appliances that are visually appealing and complement the modern design.
- **Cabinetry:** Highlight custom cabinetry with soft-close mechanisms and a premium finish.
- **Lighting:** Incorporate elegant lighting fixtures, with a focus on pendant lights over the kitchen island.
- **Contractor Presence:** Depict a skilled contractor in the scene. The contractor should either be inspecting the work or actively using professional tools. Ensure they are wearing a clean, branded uniform to add a trustworthy touch.
- **Environment:** Ensure the setting is well-lit to emphasize the quality and craftsmanship of the renovation. The overall ambiance should exude warmth and sophistication.

Ensure the description conveys a balance between luxury appeal and the personal, reliable presence of the contractor. Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
