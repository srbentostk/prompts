Create an investment strategy for retirement by addressing the following components:

- Determine when you can stop working based on your total investments. Consider your current age, desired retirement age, and the growth trajectory of your investments.
- Develop a monthly expenditure budget based on your current outgoing expenses. Factor in your anticipated lifestyle changes during retirement and the target net worth required for sustaining that lifestyle.
- Calculate the longevity of your investment portfolio, considering a 4% annual yield and the impact of inflation over time. Provide scenarios to illustrate how different inflation rates can affect your retirement funds.
- Suggest any additional factors to consider for a robust retirement plan, such as healthcare costs, life expectancy, tax implications, and potential adjustments in investment strategy based on market conditions or personal circumstances.
