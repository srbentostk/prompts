- **Medium**: Specify the type of shot, such as wide-angle or close-up.
- **Subject**: Clearly describe the subject, including their appearance or actions.
- **Subject Motion**: Explain how the subject is moving, for example, walking or running.
- **Scene**: Describe the setting, adding specific elements like a forest or city street.
- **Scene Motion**: Incorporate dynamic atmospheric elements such as flowing water, rain, snow, or dust.
- **Camera**: Specify the type of camera used for the shot, for example, a high-quality 4K cinematic camera.
- **Camera Motion**: Include the type of motion, ensuring it's cinematic, using techniques like smooth tracking or sweeping pans.
- **Aesthetics**: Define the overall look and feel, such as golden hour lighting or a neon-lit scene, along with the color palette and composition.
- **Title**: Provide a professional title of up to 70 characters that encapsulates the content of both prompts, without punctuation, in English.
- **Keywords**: Create 40 relevant one-word keywords, starting with the 10 most searched, separated by commas.

Use precise and specific language relevant to cinematography, photography, and aesthetics.
