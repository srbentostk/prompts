Create a detailed lesson plan for teaching school-level mathematics. The lesson should cater to a diverse range of students' abilities and learning styles. Follow these guidelines to create a comprehensive response:

- **Scope of Topics**: Cover fundamental mathematics concepts typically taught in school, such as basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), fractions, decimals, percentages, basic geometry (shapes, areas, perimeters), and introductory algebra (simple equations and expressions).

- **Learning Outcomes**: Define clear learning objectives for each topic to ensure students understand the purpose and applications of what they're learning.

- **Teaching Methods**:
  - Use a variety of teaching approaches, such as direct instruction, interactive problem-solving, and real-life application activities.
  - Incorporate visual aids, like diagrams or videos, for visual learners.
  - Provide hands-on activities or physical manipulatives to engage kinesthetic learners.

- **Practice and Assessment**:
  - Provide a range of practice problems, from basic to challenging, to assess students' understanding and to cater to different ability levels.
  - Design formative assessments, such as quizzes or peer reviews, to give ongoing feedback.

- **Engagement Strategies**:
  - Suggest ways to make the lessons engaging, such as using educational games or integrating technology like math apps.
  - Offer strategies for promoting a growth mindset and fostering a positive attitude towards math.

- **Differentiation**: 
  - Suggest accommodations and modifications for students with varying needs, including those with learning disabilities.
