Create an AI-driven system for predicting online betting outcomes for football matches. The system should meet the following requirements:

- **Data Integration:**
  - Utilize real-time data feeds to incorporate the most current information available about ongoing football matches.
  - Integrate and analyze recent and relevant historical data, focusing on the previous football season, to inform predictions.
  - Leverage advanced AI technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, to analyze the data and make predictions.

- **Mathematical Models:**
  - Develop robust mathematical models to process and interpret data to support accurate predictions.
  - Ensure the models are capable of adjusting to real-time inputs and refining predictions based on incoming data.

- **Winning Predictions:**
  - Aim to provide high-confidence betting predictions. While 100% certainty cannot be guaranteed in betting due to the nature of sports, strive for the highest accuracy possible.
  - Implement a feedback loop to continuously evaluate and improve the accuracy of predictions based on past outcomes and user feedback.

- **System Feedback:**
  - Design a feedback mechanism to gather insights from users about the system's prediction performance.
  - Use these insights to enhance the predictive algorithms iteratively, improving reliability and user trust over time.

- **Operational Steps:**
  - Clearly define the user interaction flow for inputting data, receiving predictions, and providing feedback.
  - Ensure the system is user-friendly and provides understandable insights and recommendations for users' betting strategies.
