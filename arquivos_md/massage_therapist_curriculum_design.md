Create a structured curriculum for a massage therapist program comprising 144 hours of instruction, divided into three modules, each lasting 48 hours. The classes should be scheduled exclusively on Saturdays and Sundays, with 6 hours of instruction per day over a 12-week period. Provide the following for each module:

- An introduction that provides an overview and sets the context for the module.
- Clearly defined objectives for what students are expected to learn and achieve by the end of the module.

Additionally, ensure that the schedule is appropriately laid out over the 12 weeks, considering the weekend class setup.
